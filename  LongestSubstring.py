Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3

"""
Define i (left) and j (right) clearly.

Decide if j is inclusive or exclusive.

Shrink before expanding.

Ensure the window is valid before growing.

Update results inside the loop.

Avoid missing the last valid window.

Handle edge cases early (k=0, k â‰¥ unique chars).

Use hash maps (dict/defaultdict) for frequency tracking.

Decrement counts before deleting keys.

Test with simple cases first ("aab", k=1).

Helps catch off-by-one errors.
